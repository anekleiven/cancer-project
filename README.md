# Cancer Project ðŸ§¬ðŸ”¬

## Overview ðŸ“‹
This repository contains analysis and visualization of cancer-related genetic data. The project explores the relationships between genes, protein domains, and variants to better understand cancer mechanisms.

## Repository Structure ðŸ“‚
- `Cancer_project_Ane.Rmd` - R Markdown source code with analysis
- `Cancer_project_Ane.html` - Rendered HTML output of the analysis
- `Cancer_project_Ane_files/` - Supporting files for the HTML output
  - `figure-html/` - Generated figures and visualizations

## Data ðŸ“Š
The `data.zip` file contains essential datasets:
- `gene_gencode_47_113_v1.0.9.rds` - Gene annotation data
- `pdb_pfam_mapping.txt` - Mapping between PDB and Pfam protein domains
- `Pfam-A.clans.tsv` - Pfam protein family classification
- `Pfam-A.regions.tsv.gz` - Pfam protein domain regions
- `variant_summary.txt.gz` - Variant information summary

The data.zip is 176mb and exceeds githubs file size limit. DM me and I will send you the file.

## Getting Started ðŸš€
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure R and required packages are installed
3. Open `Cancer_project_Ane.Rmd` in RStudio
4. Run the analysis or view the pre-rendered `Cancer_project_Ane.html`

## Requirements ðŸ”§
- R (recommended version 4.0+)
- Bioconductor packages
